Here it is! A boilerplate theme for the Horizon Framework. 

Feel free to use this however you want, and please contact me if you need any help, I'd be more than willing to help out.

**Features**
============

Horizon is an extremely powerful framework to run WordPress websites on. Here are a few of its features:

* **Awesome customisable admin panel.** - Add a new option by simply adding a new array!
* **Real time typography previews.** - Edit font size, colour, decoration, transform, and choose from over 300 Google Fonts, and see the result in *real-time*!
* **Ability to have multiple style options.** - Ideal for theme developers, or a site with a userbase which is allowed to edit the way they view the site. You can choose an entirely different layout for elements such as blog posts.
* **Various choice of thumbnails** - You can choose from a featured image, slider, video (vimeo/youtube), audio (soundcloud), quote or link thumbnail!
